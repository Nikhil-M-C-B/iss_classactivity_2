i found 5 errors

they are

there is a semicolon missing at line 1 and 10 while d
and defining the functions

for defining exponent they did *** but it should be ** in line 6

and for assigining variables they did == but it should be = in the line 3 and 4

there is no , between start and end in the function name in the line 10

at last they called is_narcissistic(num) but it actually is is_narc(num) in the line 13



sir please accept my submission it is a bit late
